My name is Shreyas Salankimatt, and I have a deep passion for coding and everything about to software development. This About serves as a showcase of my skills, interests, and projects. Feel free to explore and get to know more about my journey in the fascinating world of programming.

<h2>About Me:</h2>
My background in computer science and engineering has given me a firm foundation as a devoted software development enthusiast. I'm always experimenting with new technologies and striving for perfection in my work since I'm passionate about coding.

<h2>Skills:</h2>
These are the Programming languages/Tools I am familiar with and have used before:<br>

<b>
<li>Python, C, C++ & Java</li>
